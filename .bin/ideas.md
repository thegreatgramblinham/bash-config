Shell Script Ideas
=
 - Copy user config (vim, bash, ranger, etc) to root home dir
 - Git clone all dotfile repos and call each deploy script
 - Improve gsdir to print files changed and any pending local commits
 - gstdrop - drop all stash contents from repo
 - SSH commands to all local servers like 'shutdown' and 'reboot'
